A chessboard where the squares are colored according to how many
times they are being attacked.  E.g., if white is attacking a
square, color it red.  If white it attacking it twice, it is
darker red.  If black is attacking it, it is blue.  If it
is not being attacked, or if it is attacked the same number of
times by white and black, then give it the normal color
(which is sort of beige).
